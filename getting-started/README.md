# Getting Started

This page will help you get started on setup for the semester. The **REQUIRED** sections below must be completed by everyone.

The [Extra Credit Tasks](README.md#extra-credit-tasks) introduce tools that you'll need later in the semester. Each is worth 1 point of extra credit (EC).  You must complete the exercise by the listed due date to receive the extra credit. Note that several of these have a deadline at the end of Week 1. There are 7 exercises that can be completed.  There is an **Assignment** in Canvas for each of these where you can submit your work.

Read over all of the exercises listed here and pay special attention to the resources that are provided.  Completing all of these tasks will not only help your grade, but will better prepare you to do well in this course.

## Accessing CS Linux Systems - REQUIRED

**CS Account.** First, make sure that you have a new CS account (username with the prefix cs_).  If not, then visit <https://accounts.cs.odu.edu/> to create a new account.  Note that it may take a few minutes for the account to be set up.

**VPN.** To access CS resources, including the CS Linux servers, you need to be connected to the CS VPN.  See [VPN](https://systems.cs.odu.edu/network/vpn.html) for instructions on how to get connected.

**Linux.** Once you are connected to the CS VPN, you can use an ssh client (like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) for Windows) to access linux.cs.odu.edu.  If you're using a Mac, open Terminal and run `ssh linux.cs.odu.edu` at the command prompt.  For more information on connecting to CS Linux resources, see [Unix and Linux Services](https://systems.cs.odu.edu/Unix_and_Linux_Services).

If you have difficulties with any of these steps, you can email root@cs.odu.edu for help, or post in the Q&A Discussion Forum in Canvas.

## Creating a GitHub Account - REQUIRED

If you do not have one already, you must create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. I recommend a username that incorporates at least part of your actual name. *If you already have a GitHub account, you do not need to create a new one for this class.*

Next, you need to let me know your GitHub username so that I can create a private repository (repo) for you in our class organization. This private repo will be visible only to you and me, and it's what you'll use to store your homework assignments. Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues) to let me know your username:

* Open our public class repository, <https://github.com/odu-cs432-websci/public-fall24/>
* Click on the **Issues** tab at the top
* Create a new issue
* The title should be your name and your GitHub username. You should see my example in the list of Issues.
* Click **Submit New Issue**.

When I have created your private repository, you will receive an email notification via GitHub.

## Writing HW Reports - REQUIRED

Read the information provided in [Writing HW Reports](reports.md). This includes links to templates and an example report from a previous semester.
